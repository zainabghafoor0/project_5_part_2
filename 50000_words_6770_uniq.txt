symptoms
include
brittle
bones

lost
inches
off
his
hieght
enlarged
liver
and
spleen
internal
bleeding
and
fatigue
all
the
time
the
problem
in
type
is
attributed
to
a
genetic
mutation
where
there
is
a
lack
of
the
enzyme
glucocerebroside
in
macrophages
so
the
cells
swell
up
this
will
eventually
cause
death
enyzme
replacement
therapy
has
been
successfully
developed
and
approved
by
the
fda
in
the
last
few
years
so
that
those
patients
administered
with

called
ceredase

another
uncommon
problem
is
maternal
hemorrhage
i
don

remember
the
incidence
but
it
is
something
like
in

births
it
is
hard
to
see
how
you
could
handle
it
at
home
and
you
wouldn
t
have
very
much
time
thing
you
might
consider
is
that
people
s
risk
tradeoffs
vary
i
consider
a
risk
of
loss
of
a
loved
one
to
require
considerable
effort
in
the
avoiding
mark
you
seem
to
be
terrified
of
the
birth
process
that
s
ridiculous
and
unable
to
believe
that
women
s
bodies
are
actually
designed
to
do
it
they
aren
t
designed
they
evolved
and
much
as
it
discomforts
us
in
humans
a
trouble
free
birth
process
was
sacrificed
to
increased
brain
and
cranial
size
wild
animals
have
a
much
easier
time
with
birth
than
humans
do
domestic
horses
and
cows
typically
have
a
worse
time
to
give
you
an
idea
my
family
tree
is
complicated
because
a
few
of
my
pioneer
great
great
grandfathers
had
several
wives
and
we
never
could
figure
out
which
wife
had
each
child
one
might
ask
why
this
happened
my
great
great
grandfathers
were
by
the
time
they
reached
their
forties
quite
prosperous
farmers
nonetheless
they
lost
several
wives
each
to
the
rigors
of
childbirth
the
graveyards
in
spencer
indiana
and
boswell
north
dakota
contain
quite
a
few
gravestones
like
ida
wf
of
jacob
liptrap
and
baby
may
you
wanted
to
section
all
women
carrying
breech
in
case
one
in
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
breech
babies
get
hung
up
in
second
stage
more
like
one
in
ten
and
the
consequences
can
be
devastating
i
have
direct
experience
of
more
than
a
dozen
victims
of
a
fouled
up
breech
birth
and
now
you
want
all
babies
born
in
hospital
based
on
a
guess
of
how
likely
maternal
hemorrhage
is
and
a
false
belief
that
it
is
fatal
it
isn
t
always
fatal
but
it
is
often
fatal
when
it
happens
out
of
reach
of
adequate
help
more
often
it
permanently
damages
one
s
health
clearly
women
s
bodies
evolved
to
give
birth
i
am
no
believer
in
divine
design
however
evolution
did
not
favor
trouble
free
births
for
humans
you
have
your
kids
where
you
want
you
encourage
your
wife
to
get
six
inch
holes
cut
through
her
stomach
muscles
expose
herself
to
anesthesia
and
infection
and
whatever
other
just
in

measures
you
think
are
necessary
my
aren
t
we
wroth
i
haven
t
read
a
more
outrageous
straw
man
attack
in
months
i
can
practically
see
your
mouth
foam
we
re
statistically
sophisticated
enough
to
balance
the
risks
although
i
can
t
produce
exact
statistics
years
after
the
last
time
we
looked
them
up
rest
assured
that
we
balanced
c
section
risks
against
other
risks
i
wouldn
t
encourage
my
wife
to
have
a
caesarean
unless
it
was
clearly
indicated
on
the
other
hand
i
am
opposed
on
obvious
grounds
to
waiting
until
an
emergency
to
give
in
and
bear
this
in
mind
my
wife
took
the
lead
in
all
of
these
decisions
we
talked
things
over
and
i
did
a
lot
of
the
leg
work
but
the
main
decisions
were
really
hers
but
i
for
one
am
bothered
by
your
continued
suggestions
especially
to
the
misc
kidders
pregnant
for
the
first
time
that
birth
is
dangerous
even
fatal
and
that
all
these
unpleasant
things
are
far
better
than
the
risks
you
run
just
doing
it
naturally
i
don
t
know
of
very
many
home
birth
advocates
even
that
think
that
a
first
time
mother
should
have
her
baby
at
home
i
m
no
luddite
i
ve
had
a
section
i
m
planning
a
hospital
birth
this
time
but
for
heaven
s
sake
not
everyone
needs
that
but
people
should
bother
to
find
out
the
relative
risks
my
wife
was
unwilling
to
take
any
significant
risks
in
order
to
have
nice
surroundings
in
view
of
the
intensity
of
the
birth
experience
i
doubt
surroundings
have
much
importance
anyway
somehow
the
values
you
re
advocating
seem
all
lopsided
to
me
taking
risks
even
if
fairly
small
of
serious
permanent
harm
in
order
to
preserve
something
that
is
after
all
an
esthetic
consideration

another
option
if

to

is
to

azathioprine

taking

it

his

capacity
has

his

died

he

i
believe
he
has
a

perhaps
one
cigarette
a

or
even
less
he
tells

this
i
ve
never
seen
him
light
up
he
has
some
pretty
healthy
life
style
habits
good
diet
exercise
meditation
retreats
therapy
etc
anyhow
he
is
very
concerned
with
this
check
up
i
know
really
nothing
about
the
disease
i
believe
it
interferes
with
the
lining
of
the
lung
being
able
to
exchange
oxygen
is
a
diagnosis
of
emphysema
a
death
sentence
if
he
were
to
give
up
smoking
entirely
would
that
better
his
chances
for
recovery
what
are
some
modern
therapies
used
in
people
with
this
disease
i
would
appreciate
any

your
experience
is
valid
for
many
but
not
all
the
fact
that
you
know
a
few
people
who
have
been
overweight
and
are
now
stable
at
a
lower
normal
or
just
less
weight
does
not
contradict
the
observation
that
only
per
cent
can
maintain
ideal
weight
with
current
technology
actually
the
observation
is
that
only
of
those
who
seek
help
from
your
so
called
diet
evangelists
can
maintain
their
weight
i
happen
to
agree
with
keith
lynch
that
there
are
many
people
who
can
and
do
lose
weight
on
their
own
and
who
are
not
reflected
in
the
dismal
failure
rate
that
is
often
quoted
wasn
t
there
a
study
where
a
researcher
asked
a
more
general
population
perhaps
some
part
of
a
university
community
about
weight
loss
and
he
she
found
that
a
much
higher
percentage
had
lost
and
maintained
in
fact
adiposity
mentions
a
similar
study
search
for
life
events
in
any
recent
version
of
adiposity
the
problem
with
anecdotal
reports
about
individuals
who
have
lost
weight
and
kept
it
off
is
that
we
don
t
know
what
caused
the
weight
gain
in
the
first
place
this
is
critical
because
someone
who
gains
weight
because
of
something
temporary
drug
effect
life
event
etc
may
appear
successful
at
dieting
when
the
weight
loss
was
really
the
result
of
reversing
the
temporary
condition
that
caused
the
weight
gain

re

getting
back
to
the
original
question
in
this
thread
i
experienced
breathing
difficulties
a
few
years
ago
similar
to
those
described
in
my
case
it
turned
out
that
i
was
developing
type
i
diabetes
although
i
never
sought
direct
confirmation
of
this
from
my
doctor
i
think
that
the
breathing
problem
was
associated
with
the
presence
of
ketones
due
to
the
diabetes
i
think
that
ketosis
can
occur
in
lesser
degree
if
one
is
restricting
their
food
intake
drastically
i
don
t
know
if
this
relevant
in
this
case
but
you
might
ask
your
daughter
if
she
has
been
eating
properly

large

my

would

this
was
repeated
daily
for

the

is

either
his

will

unfortunately

was

recurrent

recurrent
volvulus
this
is
regarding
recurrent
volvulus
which
our
little
boy
has
been
suffering
from
ever
since
he
was
an
infant
he
had
a
surgery
when
he
was
one
year
old
another
surgery
had
to
be
performed
one
year
after
when
he
was
two
years
old
he
turned
three
this
february
and
he
is
still
getting
afflicted
by
this
illness
like
having
to
get
hospitalised
for
vomitting
and
accompanying
stomach
pain
he
managed
not
having
a
third
surgery
so
far
one
thing
me
and
my
wife
noticed
is
that
his
affliction
peaks
around
the
time
he
was
born
on
nearabouts
like
in
march
every
year
any
significance
to
this
why
does
this
recur
me
and
my
family
go
through
severe
pain
when
our
little
boy
have
to
undergo
surgery
why
does
surgery
not
rectify
the
situation
also
which
hospital
in
us
or
canada
specialize
in
this
malady
what
will
be
a
good
book
explaining
this
disease
in
detail
will
keeping
a
particular
diet
keep
down
the
probability
of
recurrence
as
time
goes
on
will
the
probability
of
recurrence
go
down
considering
he
is
getting
stronger
and
healthier
and
probably
less
prone
to
attacks
or
is
this
assumption
wrong
any
help
throwing
light
on
these
queries
will
be
highly
appreciated
thanks
very
much

situs

means
that
organs

body
and
can
be
complete
or
partial
it
is
interesting
medically
because
the
normal
location
of
organs
is
caused

part
by
the
normal
rotation
associated
with
ciliary
motion
so
that
in

this
laterality
can
be
random
people
with
situs

are
quite
popular
at
medical
schools
because
of
their
rarity

the
fact

most
doctors
get
a

they

s
immotile

what

purists
often
distinguish

and
pseudo
clubbing
the
difference
being
that
with
true
clubbing
the
angle
of
the
nail
when
viewed
from
the
side
is
constantly
negative
when
proceeding
distally
towards
the
fingertip
with
pseudo
clubbing
the
angle
is
initially
positive
then
negative
which
is
the
normal
situation
real
internists
can
talk
for
hours
about
clubbing
i
m
limited
to
a
couple
of
minutes
whether
this
distinction
has
anything
to
do
with
reality
is
entirely
unclear
but
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
internists
love
to
paw
over
during
rounds
supposedly
only
true
clubbing
is
associated
with
disease
the
problem
is
that
the
list
of
diseases
associated
with
clubbing
is
quite
long
and
includes
both
congenital
conditions
and
acquired
disease
since
many
of
these
diseases
are
associated
with
cardiopulmonary
problems
leading
to
right
to
left
shunts
and
chronic
hypoxemia
it
is
very
reasonable
to
get
a
chest
xray
however
many
of
the
congenital
abnormalities
would
only
be
diagnosed
with
a
cardiac
catheterization
the
cause
of
clubbing
is
unclear
but
presumably
relates
to
some
factor
causing
blood
vessels
in
the
distal
fingertip
to
dilate
abnormally
clubbing
is
one
of
those
things
from
an
examination
which
is
a
tipoff
to
do
more
extensive
examination
often
however
the
cause
of
the
clubbing
is
quite
apparent

my
question
is
is
this
an
unusual
form
of
menangitis
how
is
it
transmitted
how
does
it
work
ie
how
does
it
kill
so
quickly
there
are
many
organisms
viral
bacterial
and
fungal
which
can
cause
meningitits
and
the
course
of
these
infections
varies
widely
the
causes
of
bacterial
meningitis
vary
with
age
in
adults
pneumococcus
the
same
organism
which
causes
pneumococcal
pneumonia
is
the
most
common
cause
while
in
children
hemophilus
influenzae
is
the
most
common
cause
what
you
are
describing
is
meningitis
from
neisseria
meningitidis
which
is
the
second
most
common
cause
of
bacterial
meningitis
in
both
groups
but
with
lower
incidence
in
infants
this
organism
is
also
called
the
meningococcus
and
is
the
source
of
the
common
epidemics
of
meningitis
that
occur
and
are
popularized
in
the
press
without
prompt
treatment
and
even
with
it
in
some
cases
the
organism
typically
causes
death
within
a
day
this
organism
feared
as
it
is
is
actually
grown
from
the
throats
of
many
normal
adults
it
can
get
to
the
meninges
by
different
ways
but
blood
borne
spread
is
probably
the
usual
case
rifampin
an
oral
antibiotic
is
often
given
to
family
and
contacts
of
a
case
of
meningococcal
meningitis
by
the
way
sorry
but
i
don
t
have
time
for
a
more
detailed
reply
meningitis
is
a
huge
topic
and
sci
med
can
t
do
it
justice

re
sinus
vs
migraine
was
re
sinus
endoscopy
i
noticed
several
years
ago
that
when
i
took
analgesics
fairly
regularly
motrin
at
the
time
i
seemed
to
get
a
lot
of
migraines
but
had
forgotten
about
that
until
i
started
reading
some
of
the
posts
here
i
generally
don
t
take
nsaids
or
tylenol
for
headaches
because
i
ve
found
them
to
be
ineffective
however
i
have
two
other
pain
sources
that
force
me
to
take
nsaids
currently
naprosyn
first
is
some
pelvic
pain
that
i
get
at
the
beginning
of
my
period
and
then
much
worse
at
midcycle
i
have
had
surgery
for
endometriosis
in
the
past
years
ago
so
the
drs
tell
me
that
my
pain
is
probably
due
to
the
endometriosis
coming
back
i
ve
tried
synarel
it
reduced
the
pain
while
i
took
it
mos
but
the
pain
returned
immediately
after
i
stopped
three
doctors
have
suggested
hysterectomy
as
the
only
real
solution
to
my
problem
although
i
don
t
expect
to
have
any
more
children
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
having
my
uterus
and
one
remaining
ovary
removed
the
first
ovary
was
removed
when
i
had
the
surgery
for
endometriosis
one
of
the
drs
that
suggested
i
get
a
hysterectomy
is
an
expert
in
laser
surgery
but
perhaps
thinks
that
type
of
procedure
is
only
worthwhile
on
women
who
still
plan
to
have
children
so
basically
all
i
m
left
with
is
toughing
out
the
pain
this
would
be
impossible
without
naprosyn
or
something
similar
but
not
aspirin
that
doesn
t
work
and
motrin
gave
me
horrible
gastritis
a
few
years
ago
so
i
m
through
with
it
in
fact
naprosyn
works
very
well
at
eliminating
the
pain
if
i
take
it
regularly
as
i
did
when
i
had
severe
back
pain
and
pain
in
both
legs
as
i
ll
discuss
in
a
moment
generally
though
i
wait
until
i
have
the
pain
before
i
take
the
naprosyn
but
then
it
takes
several
hours
for
it
reduce
the
pain
it
s
actually
quite
effective
at
reducing
the
pain
it
just
takes
quite
a
while
in
the
meantime
i
m
frequently
in
severe
pain
the
other
pain
source
i
have
is
chronic
lower
back
pain
resulting
in
bilateral
radiculopathy
i
ve
had
mris
xrays
ct
scan
and
emgs
i
ve
had
of
them
and
don
t
intend
to
ever
do
that
again
with
nerve
conduction
tests
the
tests
have
not
been
conclusive
as
to
what
is
causing
my
back
and
leg
pain
the
mri
reports
both
say
i
have
several
bulging
degeneratig
disks
and
from
the
xrays
and
mri
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
i
have
arthritis
the
reading
on
the
ct
scan
was
that
there
are
two
herniations
l
l
and
l
l
but
others
hav
looked
at
the
films
and
concluded
that
there
are
no
herniations
the
second
emg
and
nerve
conduction
studies
shows
significant
denervation
compared
to
the
first
emg
oh
yeah
i
had
some
other
horrible
test
called
something
like
somatic
evoked
response
which
showed
that
the
internal
nerves
are
working
fine
anyway
the
bottom
line
is
that
i
sometimes
have
severe
pain
in
both
legs
and
back
pain
the
back
pain
is
there
all
the
time
but
i
can
live
with
it
when
the
leg
pain
is
there
i
need
some
analgesic
anti
inflammatory
medication
to
reduce
the
pain
to
a
level
where
i
can
work
so
i
took
naprosyn
regulary
for
months
every
time
i
tried
to
stop
the
leg
pain
got
worse
so
i
d
always
resume
since
last
november
i
have
taken
it
much
less
frequently
and
primarily
for
the
pelvic
pain
i
have
been
going
to
physical
therapy
for
the
last
months
times
a
week
after
the
first
month
or
so
my
therapist
put
me
on
pelvic
traction
she
had
tried
it
earlier
but
it
had
caused
a
lot
of
pain
in
my
back
this
time
she
tried
it
at
a
lower
weight
after
a
month
or
two
the
pain
in
my
legs
began
going
away
but
the
traction
aways
caused
discomfort
in
my
lower
back
which
could
be
reduced
with
ultrasound
and
massage
so
now
i
don
t
have
nearly
as
much
pain
in
my
legs
in
fact
my
therapist
took
me
off
traction
about
weeks
ago
getting
back
to
my
original
reason
for
this
post
even
if
i
can
avoid
taking
analgesic
for
headaches
i
really
can
t
avoid
them
entirely
because
i
have
other
pain
sources
that
force
me
to
use
them
oh
i
forgot
to
mention
that
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
i
have
back
surgery
but
i
m
avoiding
that
too
i
find
the
migraines
difficult
to
deal
with
occassionally
i
have
to
take
off
work
but
usually
i
can
work
but
at
a
reduced
capacity
i
m
a
systems
engineer
and
do
a
lot
of
reading
and
writing
when
the
pelvic
pain
is
bad
i
can
t
concentrate
much
i
usually
end
up
jumping
out
of
my
chair
every
few
minutes
because
the
pain
is
so
bothersome
when
the
pain
in
my
back
is
bad
it
can
cause
severe
burning
in
both
legs
shooting
pains
in
my
legs
electric
shock
type
of
pain
in
my
feet
and
toes
and
basically
when
it
gets
bad
i
can
t
really
sit
at
all
then
i
end
up
spending
most
of
my
time
home
and
in
bed
so
even
if
the
analgesics
contribute
to
the
migraines
the
migraines
are
more
tolerable
than
the
other
pain
sources
i
get
a
lot
of
migraines
an
average
of
to
a
month
which
last
days
i
ve
taken
cafergot
the
first
time
the
caffiene
really
got
to
me
so
i
reduced
the
dosage
but
i
don
t
like
the
side
effects
if
i
take
more
than
two
i
get
diahrea
if
i
get
a
very
bad
headache
i
will
eventually
take
the
cafergot
my
neurologist
wasn
t
very
helpful
when
i
told
him
my
problems
with
cafergot
he
said
that
when
sumatriptan
becomes
available
i
should
try
that
i
ve
tried
several
other
medications
fiornal
midrin
fiornal
with
codeine
tegretol
and
inderal
but
they
either
didn
t
work
or
i
couldn
t
tolerate
them
so
what
can
i
do
my
doctor
s
seem
to
be
satisfied
with
me
just
trying
to
tolerate
the
pain
which
i
agree
with
most
of
the
time
but
not
when
i
have
a
lot
of
pain
i
ve
had
some
bad
experiences
with
surgery
my
heart
stopped
once
from
the
anesthesia
i
was
told
that
it
was
likely
the
succinylcholine
and
i
ve
already
had
surgery
several
times
anyway
the
point
of
what
i
m
saying
is
that
even
if
analgesics
can
contribute
to
migraines
some
people
need
to
take
them
to
tolerate
other
pain

my
y
o
son
has
the
usual
teenage
spotty
chin
and
greasy
nose
i
bought
him
clearasil
face
wash
and
ointment
i
think
that
is
probably
enough
along
with
the
usual
good
diet
however
he
is
on
at
me
to
get
some
product
called
dalacin
t
which
used
to
be
a
doctor
s
prescription
only
treatment
but
is
not
available
over
the
chemist
s
counter
i
have
asked
a
couple
of
pharmacists
who
say
either
his
acne
is
not
severe
enough
for
dalacin
t
or
that
clearasil
is
ok
i
had
the
odd
spots
as
a
teenager
nothing
serious
his
father
was
the
same
so
i
don
t
figure
his
acne
is
going
to
escalate
into
something
disfiguring
but
i
know
kids
are
senstitive
about
their
appearance
i
am
wary
because
a
neighbour
s
son
had
this
wierd
malady
that
was
eventually
put
down
to
an
overdose
of
vitamin
a
from
acne
treatment
i
want
to
help
but
with
appropriate
treatment
my
son
also
has
some
scaliness
around
the
hairline
on
his
scalp
sort
of
teenage
cradle
cap
any
pointers
advice
on
this
we
have
tried
a
couple
of
anti
dandruff
shampoos
and
some
of
these
are
inclined
to
make
the
condition
worse
not
better
shall
i
bury
the
kid
till
he
s
no
i
was
one
of
the
lucky
ones
very
little
acne
as
a
teenager
i
didn
t
have
any
luck
with
clearasil
even
though
my
skin
gets
oily
it
really
only
gets
miserable
pimples
when
it
s
dry
frequent
lukewarm
water
rinses
on
the
face
might
help
getting
the
scalp
thing
under
control
might
help
that
could
be
as
simple
as
submerging
under
the
bathwater
till
it
s
softened
and
washing
it
out
taking
a
one
a
day
vitamin
mineral
might
help
i
ve
heard
iodine
causes
trouble
and
that
it
is
used
in
fast
food
restaurants
to
sterilize
equipment
which
might
be
where
the
belief
that
greasy
foods
cause
acne
came
from
i
notice
grease
on
my
face
not
immediately
removed
will
cause
acne
even
from
eating
meat
keeping
hair
rinse
mousse
dip
and
spray
off
the
face
will
help
warm
water
bath
soaks
or
cloths
on
the
face
to
soften
the
oil
in
the
pores
will
help
prevent

body
oil
is
hydrophilic
loves
water
and
it
softens
and
washes
off
when
it
has

chance
that
s
why
hair
goes
limp
with
oilyness
becoming
convinced
that
the
best
thing
to
do
with
a
whitehead
is
leave
it
alone
will
save
him
days
of
pimple
misery
any
prying
of
black
or
whiteheads
can
cause
infections
the
red
spots
of
pimples
usually
a
whitehead
will
break
naturally
in
a
day
and
there
won
t
be
an
infection
afterwards
tell
him
that
it
s
normal
to
have
some
pimples
but
the
cosmetic
industry
makes
it
s
money
off
of
selling
people
on
the
idea
that
they
are
an
incredible
defect
to
be
hidden
at
any
cost
even
that
of
causing
more
pimples

sufferer

as
a

who
has
looked
over

carefully
i
believe
the
following
are
reasonable
conclusions
millions
of
people
suffer
from
chronic
tinnitus
the
cause
it
not
understood
there
is
no
accepted
treatment
that
cures
it
some
experimental
treatments
may
have
helped
some
people
a
bit
but
there
have
be
no
reports
even
anecdotal
of
massive
good
results
with
any
of
these
experimental
drugs
some
people
with
chronic
loud
tinnitus
use
noise

sudden
onset
loud
tinnitus
can
be
caused
by
injuries
and
sometimes
abates

after
a

aspirin
is
well
known
to
exacerbate
tinnitus
in
some
people
there
is
a
national
association
of
tinnitus
sufferers
in

one
usually
gets
used
to
it
especially
when
concentrating
on
something
else
the
tinnitus
becomes
unnoticed
stress
and
lack

make
tinnitus
more
annoying

i
may
not
be
the
world
s
greatest
expert
on
chiggers
a
type
of
mite
indigenous
to
the
south
but
i
certainly
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
contemplating
the
little
buggers
over
the
past
six
years
since
we
moved
to
n
c
here
are
some
observations
gained
from
painful
experience
reactions
to
chiggers
vary
greatly
from
person
to
person
some
people
get
tiny
red
bites
others
like
me
are
more
sensitive
and
get
fairly
large
swollen
sore
like
affairs
chigger
bites
are
the
gift
that
keeps
on
giving
i
swear
that
these
things
will
itch
for
months
there
is
a
lot
of
folklore
about
chiggers
i
think
most
of
it
is
fiction
i
have
tried
to
do
research
on
the
critters
since
they
have
such
an
effect
on
me
the
only
book
i
could
find
on
the
subject
was
a
single
book
in
unc
s
special
collections
library
i
have
not
yet
gone
through
what
is
required
to
get
it
based
on
my
experience
and
that
of
my
family
members
the
old
folk
remedy
of
fingernail
polish
simply
doesn
t
work
i
recall
reading
that
the
theory
upon
which
it
is
based
that
the
chiggers
burrow
into
your
skin
and
continue
to
party
there
is
false
i
think
it
is
more
likely
that
the
reaction
is
to
toxins
of
some
sort
the
little
pests
release
but
this
is
speculation
the
best
approach
is
prevention
a
couple
of
things
work
well
a
good
insect
repellent
deet
such
as
deep
woods
off
liberally
applied
to
ankles
waistband
etc
is
a
good
start
there
is
another
preparation
called
chig
away
that
is
a
combination
of
sulfur
and
some
kind
of
cream
cortisone
that
originally
was
prepared
for
the
army
and
is
not
commercially
available
in
the
summer
i
put
this
on
my
ankles
every
morning
when
i
get
up
on
weekends
since
i
literally
can
t
go
outside
where
we
live
in
the
country
without
serious
consequences
they
apparently
don
t
like
sulfur
much
at
all
you
can
use
sulfur
as
a
dust
on
your
body
or
clothing
to
repel
them
no
amount
of
prevention
will
be
completely
successful
forget
the
fingernail
polish
i
have
finally
settled
upon
a
treatment
that
involves
topical
application
of
a
combination
of
cortisone
creme
reduces
the
inflamation
and
swelling
and
benzocaine
relieves
the
itch
i
won
t
tell
you
all
the
things
i
ve
tried
nor
will
i
tell
you
some
of
the
things
my
wife
does
since
this
counts
as
minor
surgery
and
is
best
not
mentioned
i
also
think
it
gains
nothing
the
swelling
and
itching
can
also
be
significantly
relieved
by
the
application
of
hot
packs
and
this
seems
to
speed
recovery
as
well
doctors
seem
not
to
care
much
about
chiggers
the
urban
and
suburban
doctors
apparently
don
t
encounter
them
much
and
the
rural
doctors
seem
to
regard
them
as
a
force
of
nature
that
one
must
endure
i
suspect
that
anyone
who
could
come
up
with
a
good
treatment
for
chiggers
would
make
a
lot
of
money

my
biggest
resentment
is
the
doctor
who
makes
it
seem
like
most
people
with
dizziness
can
be
cured
that
s
definitely
not
the
case
in
most
cases
like
i
said
above
it
is
a
long
tedious
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizziness
not
just
dizziness
most
patients
with
acute
or
subacute
dizziness
will
get
better
the
vertiginous
spells
of
meniere
s
will
also
eventually
go
away
however
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
to
anyone
suffering
with
vertigo
dizziness
or
any
variation
thereof
my
best
advice
to
you
as
a
fellow
sufferer
is
this
just
keep
searching
don
t
let
the
doctors
tell
you
there
s
nothing
that
can
be
done
do
your
own
research
and
let
your
this
may
have
helped
you
but
i
m
not
sure
it
is
good
general
advice
the
odds
that
you
are
going
to
find
some
miracle
with
your
own
research
that
is
secret
or
hidden
from
general
knowledge
for
this
or
any
other
disease
are
slim
when
good
answers
to
these
problems
are
found
it
is
usually
in
all
the
newspapers
until
then
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
on
the
medical
problem
may
divert
that
energy
from
more
productive
things
in
life
a
limited
amount
should
be
spent
to
assure
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
story
but
after
it
becomes
clear
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
problem
for
which
medicine
has
no
good
solution
perhaps
the
best
strategy
is
to
join
the
support
group
and
keep
abreast
of
new
findings
but
not
to
make
a
career

something
what

don

understand
about
the
inserts
is
that
they
report
every
adverse
side
effect
ever
reported
without
substantiating
that
the

was
responsible
the
insert
is
a
legal
document
to
slough
liability
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
physician
if
something
was
to
happen
if
patients
want
to
have
the
most
useful
and
reliable
information
on
a
drug
they
would
be
so
much
better
off
getting
hold
of
one
of
the
ama
drug
evaluation
books
or
something
similar
that
is
much
more
scientific
there
are
very
few
drugs
that
someone
hasn
t
reported
a
death
from
taking
patients
don
t
realize
that
and
don
t
usually
appreciate
the
risks
to
themselves
properly
i
m
sure
herman
is
going
to
go
ballistic
but
so
be
it
another
problem
is
that
probably
most
drugs
have
been
reported
to
cause
impotence
half
the
males
who
read
that
will
falsely
assume
it
could
permanently
cause
them
to
lose
sexual
function
and
so
will
refuse
to
take
any
drug
like
that
this
can
be
a
real
problem
for
pdr
readers
there
needs
to
be
some
way
of
providing
patients
with
tools
geared
to
them
that
allow
them
to
get
the
information
they
need
i
am
involved
in
a
research
project
to
do
that
with
migraine
as
the
domain
it
involves
a
computer
system
that
will
provide
answers
to
questions
about
migraine
as
well
as
the
therapy
prescribed
for
the
patient
for
common
illnesses
such
as
migraine
and
hypertension
this
may
help
quite
a
bit
the
patient
could
spend
as
much
time
as
needed
with
the
computer
and
this
would
then
not
burden
the
physician
clearly
physicians
in
large
part
fail
to
answer
all
the
questions
patients
have
as
is
demonstrated
over
and
over
here
on

that

should
have
found

multiple
drug
resistance
in
tb
is
a
relatively
new
phenomenon
and
one
of
the
largest
contributing
factors
is
that
people
are
no

as
scared
of
tb
as
they
were
before
antibiotics
it
was
roughly
as
feared
as
hiv

now
not
that
new
years
ago
we
had
drug
addicts
harboring
active
tb
that
was
resistant
to
everything
in
chicago
the
difference
now
is
that
such
strains
have
become
virulent
in
the
old

such
tb
was
weak
it
didn

spread
to
other
people
very

just
infected

in

it
developed

non

has

there
is

a

ones
due

such

now
however
with

we
are

may

the

simply
detectors

spectral
sensitivities
and
are
not
any
more
color
sensitive
than
are
rods
ommatidia

photoreceptors
color
vision
arises
because
outputs
of
receptors
which
sample
different

the

use
hydrogen

only
if
you
are
taking
a
good
daily
dose
of
some
of
the
various
anti
oxidants
described
above
vitamin
mineral
supplements
are
more
effective
and
much
less
expensive
when
combined
together
in
mega
doses
into
single
tablets
made
from
natural
sources
cancer
cells
can
not
live
in
a
strong
maxwell
north
magnetic
field
especially
if
it
is
pulsating
on
and
off
a
strong
south
magnetic
field
is
an
aphrodisiac
in
my
opinion
all
types
of
ionizing
radiation
treatments
for
cancer
should
be
replaced
with
daily
minute
doses
of
pulsating
maxwell
north
magnetic
fields
properly
made
and
operated
radionics
psionics
machines
can
both
diagnose
and
cure
all
forms
of

as
well
as
most
other
medical
problems
some
radionics
psionics
machines
can
even

tumors
etc
with

interferon

even
drug
addiction
mg

of
chelated
zinc
can
help
prevent
or
cure
prostate
trouble
this
list
is
not
exhaustive
the
above
natural
remedies
can
cure
both
diagnosed
and
un
diagnosed
cancers
as
well
as
prevent
them
and
also
prevent
and
cure
many
other
medical
problems
including
heart
diseases
they
are
not
too
simple
and
inexpensive
to
work
effectively
besides
acting
on
a
person
biologically
and
chemically
these
remedies
especially
the
day
fast
and
the
grape
diet
send
a
strong
message
to
one
s
subconscious
mind
programming
it
to
cure
the
cancer
in
my
opinion
if
a
person
finds
out
that
s
he
has
cancer
then
s
he
should
promptly
try
at
least
the
first
remedies
described
above
in
sequence
starting
with
the
day
fast
before
resorting
to

my
biggest
resentment
is
the
doctor
who
makes
it
seem
like
most
people
with
dizziness
can
be
cured
that
s
definitely
not
the
case
in
most
cases
like
i
said
above
it
is
a
long
tedious
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizziness
not
just
dizziness
most
patients
with
acute
or
subacute
dizziness
will
get
better
the
vertiginous
spells
of
meniere
s
will
also
eventually
go
away
however
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
all
true
and
all
good
points
to
anyone
suffering
with
vertigo
dizziness
or
any
variation
thereof
my
best
advice
to
you
as
a
fellow
sufferer
is
this
just
keep
searching
don
t
let
the
doctors
tell
you
there
s
nothing
that
can
be
done
do
your
own
research
and
let
your
this
may
have
helped
you
but
i
m
not
sure
it
is
good
general
advice
the
odds
that
you
are
going
to
find
some
miracle
with
your
own
research
that
is
secret
or
hidden
from
general
knowledge
for
this
or
any
other
disease
are
slim
when
good
answers
to
these
then
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
on
the
medical
problem
may
divert
that
energy
from
more
productive
things
in
life
a
limited
amount
should
be
spent
to
assure
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
story
but
after
it
becomes
clear
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
problem
for
which
medicine
has
no
good
solution
perhaps
the
best
strategy
is
to
join
the
support
group
and
keep
abreast
of
new
findings
but
not
to
make
a
career
out
of
it
well
making
a
career
out
of
it
is
a
bit
strong
i
still
believe
that
doing
your
own
research
is
very
very
necessary
i
would
not
have
progressed
as
much
as
i
have
today
unless
i
had
spent
the
many
hours
in
stanford
s
med
library
as
i
have
done
and
years
ago
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
medicine
that
would
help
me
so
should
i
have
stopped
searching
thank
goodness
i
didn
t
now
i
found
that
there
is
indeed
medicine
that
helps
me
i
think
that
what
you
ve
said
is
kind
of
idealistic
that
you
would
go
to
one
doctor
get
a
diagnosis
maybe
get
a
second
opinion
and
then
move
on
with
your
life
just
as
an
example
having
seen
of
the
top
specialists
in
this
field
in
the
country
i
have
received
different
diagnoses
these
are
the
top
names
the
ones
that
people
come
to
from
all
over
the
country
i
have
had
to
sort
all
of
this
out
myself
going
to
a
support
group
and
in
fact
heading
that
support
group
was
helpful
for
a
while
but
after
a
point
i
found
it
very
unproductive
it
was
much
more
productive
to
do
library
research
make
phone
calls
and
put
together
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
myself
a
recent
movie
lorenzo
s
oil
offers
a
perfect
example
of
what
i
m
talking
about
if
you
haven
t
seen
it
you
should
it
s
not
a
put
down
of
doctor
s
and
neither
is
what
i
m
saying
doctors
are
only
human
and
can
only
do
so
much
but
there
are
those
of
us
out
here
who
are
intelligent
and
able
to
sometimes
find
a
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
might
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed
i
guess
i
m
biased
because
dizziness
is
one
of
those
weird
things
that
is
still
so
unknown
if
i
had
a
broken
arm
or
a
weak
heart
or
failing
kidneys
i
might
not
have
the
same
opinion
that
s
because
those
things
are
much
more
tangible
and
have
much
more
concise
definitions
and
treatments
with
dizziness
you
just
have
to
decide
to
live
with
it
or
decide
to
live
with
it
while
trying
to
find
your
way
out
of
it

hook

run

that

you
purchase

a

then
you
can
move

it

a
three

each

each

i
have
a
copy
of
this
and
it
works
as
advertised
i
would
say
it
is
better
for
rsi
prevention
than
rsi
management
because
it
does
not
allow
breaks
at
periods
less
than
minutes
also
it
interrupts
you
based
on
clock
time
rather
than
typing
time
which
is
not
so
helpful
unless
you
use
the
keyboard
all

many

have

that
count
down

they
usually
reset
easily
to

either
manually

while
these

a
very
basic
tool
they
are
very
useful
if
you
are
writing
reading
driving
or
doing
anything
away
from
a
computer
which
can
still
cause
or
aggravate
rsi
the
great
advantage
is
that
they
remind
you
to
break
from
whatever
you
are
doing
comments
my
own
experience
was
that
cutting
down
a
lot
on
my
typing
led
to
my
writing
a
lot
more
and
still
reading
as
much
as
ever
which
actually
aggravated
the
rsi
in
my
right
arm
though
the
left
arm
improved

a
count
down

watch
has
been
very
useful

i
have

i
wrote
or
to
use
a
phrasing
that
i
think
is
more
accurate
science
is
the
investigation
of
phenomena
that
avoids
methods

that
are

to
be
erroneous

i
can
agree
with
this
if
you
are
talking
about
the
less
fundamental
aspects
of
scientific
method
in
fact
i
don
t
see
the
alternative
as
i
don
t
think
that
the
fundamentals
are
capable
of
experimental
investigation
in
saying
this
i
am
agreeing
with
the
work
of
people
like
kuhn
feyerabend
and
lakatos
while
methodology
cannot
be
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
experimental
investigation
as
that
to
which
it
is
applied
it
can
be
critically
appraised
methodologies
can
be
compared
to
each
other
sometimes
by
the
conflicting
results
they
produce
this
kind
of
critical
appraisal
and
comparison
together
with
the
inappropriateness
of
existing
methodologies
for
new
fields
of
study
is
what
drives
the
evolution
of
methodologies
and
how
we
think
about
them
as
usual
you
are
missing
the
whole
point
russell
because
you
are
not
willing
to
even
consider
questionning
your
basic
article
of
faith
which
is
that
science
is
merely
a
matter
of
methodology
and
that
the
highest
purpose
of
science
is
to
avoid
making
mistakes
this
is
like
saying
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
business
management
is
accurate
bookkeeping
if
science
were
no
more
than
methodology
and
not
making
mistakes
it
would
be
a
poor
thing
indeed
what
was
the
methodology
of
darwin
what
was
the
methodology
of
einstein
what
was
for
that
matter
the
methodology
of
jenner
and
pasteur
in
an
earlier
article
russell
turpin
writes
none
of
the
foregoing
should
be
read
as
meaning
that
we
should
open
the
door
to
practitioners
of
quackery
and
psuedo
science
modern
advocates
of
homeopathy
chiropracty
and
traditional
chinese
medicine
receive
little
respect
because
for
the
most
part
they
use
methods
and
reasoning
that
the
kind
of
research
lee
lady
recommends
has
shown
to
be
terribly
faulty
this
does
not
imply
that
all
their
treatments
are
ineffective
it
does
imply
that
those
who
rely
on
faulty
methodology
and
reasoning
are
incapable
of
discovering
which
treatments
are
effective
and
which
are
not
first
of
all
i
think
you
are
arguing
against
a
straw
man
because
i
don
t
think
that
anyone
here
is
arguing
that
quackery
pseudo
science
homeopathy
chiropracty
and
traditional
chinese
medicine
should
be
accepted
as
science
i
in
particular
think
the
basic
ideas
of
homeopathy
and
chiropracty
seem
extremely
flaky
what
some
of
us
do
believe
however
is
that
some
of
these
things
including
some
of
the
flaky
ideas
are
deserving
of
serious
scientific
attention
if
in
fact
it
were
true
as
you
have
stated
above
that
those
who
do
not
use
the
currently
fashionable
methodology
can
have
no
idea
what
is
effective
and
what
is
not
then
science
today
would
not
exist
for
all
of
current
science
is
based
on
the
past
work
of
scientists
whose
methodology
by
current
standards
was
seriously
flawed
it
is
certainly
true
that
as
methodology
improves
we
need
to
re
examine
those
results
derived
in
the
past
using
less
perfect
methodologies
it
is
also
true
that
the
results
obtained
by
people
today
who
still
rely
on
those
early
methodologies
needs
to
be
re
examined
in
a
more
rigorous
fashion
by
those
qualified
to
do
so
credibly
but
to
say
that
nobody
who
fails
to
do
elaborate
double
blind
studies
is
capable
of
knowing
their
ass
from
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
to
say
that
no
ideas
that
come
from
outside
the
scientific
establishment
could
possibly
be
worthy
of
serious
investigation
this
truly
marks
one
s
attitude
as
doctrinaire
cultist
this
attitude
is
not
compatible
with
a
belief
in
reason
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

problems
come
in
two
main
types
local
conditions
and
diffuse
conditions
local
problems
are
what
you
d
expect
specific
muscles
tendons
tendon
sheaths
nerves
etc
being
inflamed
or
otherwise
hurt
diffuse
conditions
often
mistaken
for
local
problems
can
involve
muscle
discomfort
pain
burning
and
or
tingling
with
identifiable
areas
of
tenderness
in
muscles
although
they
re
not
necessarily
the
problem
why
does
occupational
overuse
syndrome
occur
here
s
the
theory
normally
your
muscles
and
tendons
get
blood
through
capillaries
which
pass
among
the
muscle
fibers
when
you
tense
a
muscle
you
restrict
the
blood
flow
by
the
time
you
re
exerting
of
your
full
power
you
re
completely
restricting
your
blood
flow
without
fresh
blood
your
muscles
use
stored
energy
until
they
run
out
then
they
switch
to
anaerobic
without
oxygen
metabolism
which
generates
nasty
by
products
like
lactic
acid
which
cause
pain
once
one
muscle
hurts
all
its
neighbors
tense
up
perhaps
to
relieve
the
load
this
makes
sense
for
your
normal
sort
of
injury
but
it
only
makes
things
worse
with
repetitive
motion
more
tension
means
less
blood
flow
and
the
cycle
continues
another
by
product
of
the
lack
of
blood
flow
is
tingling
and
numbness
from
your
nerves
they
need
blood
too
anyway
when
you
re
typing
too
much
you
re
never
really
giving
a
change
for
the
blood
to
get
back
where
it
belongs
because
your
muscles
never
relax
enough
to
let
the
blood
through
stress
poor
posture
and
poor
ergonomics
only
make
things
worse
specific
injuries
you
may
have
heard
of
note
most
injuries
come
in
two
flavors
acute
and
chronic
acute
injuries
are
severely
painful
and
noticable
chronic
conditions
have
less
pronounced
symptoms
but
are
every
bit
as
real
tenosynovitis
an
inflamation
of
the
tendon
sheath
chronic
tenosynovitis
occurs
when
the
repetitive
activity
is
mild
or
intermittent
not
enough
to
cause
acute
inflamation
but
enough
to
exceed
the
tendon
sheath
s
ability
to
lubricate
the
tendon
as
a
result
the
tendon
sheath
thickens
gets
inflamed
and
you
ve
got
your
problem
tendonitis
an
inflammation
of
a
tendon
repeated
tensing
of
a
tendon
can
cause
inflamation
eventually
the
fibers
of
the
tendon
start
separating
and
can
even
break
leaving
behind
debris
which
induces
more
friction
more
swelling
and
more
pain
sub
acute
tendonitis
is
more
common
which
entails
a
dull
ache
over
the
wrist
and
forearm
some
tenderness
and
it
gets
worse
with
repetitive
activity
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
the
nerves
that
run
through
your
wrist
into
your
fingers
get
trapped
by
the
inflamed
muscles
around
them
symptoms
include
feeling
pins
and
needles
tingling
numbness
and
even
loss
of
sensation
cts
is
often
confused
for
a
diffuse
condition
adverse
mechanical
tension
also
known
as
neural
tension
this
is
where
the
nerves
running
down
to
your
arm
have
become
contracted
and
possibly
compressed
as
a
result
of
muscle
spasms
in
the
shoulders
and
elsewhere
amt
can
often
misdiagnosed
as
or
associated
with
one
of
the
other
oos
disorders
it
is
largely
reversible
and
can
be
treated
with
physiotherapy
brachial
plexus
stretches
and
trigger
point
therapy
others
for
just
about
every
part
of
your
body
there
s
a
fancy
name
for
a
way
to
injure
it
by
now
you
should
be
getting
an
idea
of
how
oos
conditions
occur
and
why
just
be
careful
many
inexperienced
doctors
misdiagnose
problems
as
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
when
in
reality
you
may
have
a
completely
different
problem
always
get
a
second
opinion
before
somebody
does
something
drastic
to
you
like
surgery
typing
posture
ergonomics
prevention
treatment
the
most
important
element
of
both
prevention
and
recovery
is
to
reduce
tension
in
the
muscles
and
tendons
this
requires
learning
how
to
relax
if
you
re
under
a
load
of
stress
this
is
doubly
important
tune
out
the
world
and
breath
deep
and
regular
relaxing
should
become
a
guiding
principle
in
your
work
every
three
minutes
take
a
three
second
break
every
three
minutes
take
a
three
second
break
really
do
it
every
three
minutes
it
s
also
helpful
to
work
in
comfortable
surroundings
calm
down
and
relax
if
you
can
t
sleep
you
really
need
to
focus
on
this
rest
sleep
and
relaxation
are
really
a
big
deal
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
treatments
of
course
drugs
can
reduce
inflamation
and
pain
custom
molded
splints
can
forcefully
prevent
bad
posture
surgery
can
fix
some
problems
exercise
can
help
strengthen
your
muscles
regular
stretching
can
help
prevent
injury
good
posture
and
a
good
ergonomic
workspace
promote
reduced
tension
ice
or
hot
cold
contrast
baths
also
reduce
swelling
only
your
doctor
can
say
what
s
best
for
you
posture
here
are
some
basic
guidelines
i
so
liked
the
way
this
was
written
in
the
new
zealand
book
that
i
m
lifting
it
almost
verbatim
from
appendix
dwallach
let
your
shoulders
relax
let
your
elbows
swing
free
keep
your
wrists
straight
pull
your
chin
in
to
look
down
don
t
flop
your
head
forward
keep
the
hollow
in
the
base
of
your
spine
try
leaning
back
in
the
chair
don
t
slouch
or
slump
forward
alter
your
posture
from
time
to
time
every
minutes
get
up
and
bend
your
spine
backward
set
the
seat
height
first
your
feet
should
be
flat
on
the
floor
there
should
be
no
undue
pressure
on
the
underside
of
your
thighs
near
the
knees
and
your
thighs
should
not
slope
too
much
now
draw
yourself
up
to
your
desk
and
see
that
its
height
is
comfortable
to
work
at
if
you
are
short
this
may
be
impossible
the
beest
remedy
is
to
raise
the
seat
height
and
prevent
your
legs
from
dangling
by
using
a
footrest
now
adjust
the
backrest
height
so
that
your
buttocks
fit
into
the
space
between
the
backrest
and
the
seat
pan
the
backrest
should
support
you
in
the
hollow
of
your
back
so
adjust
its
tilt
to
give
firm
support
in
this
area
if
you
operate
a
keyboard
you
will
be
able
to
spend
more
time
leaning
back
so
experiment
with
a
chair
with
a
taller
backrest
if
available
now
i
diverge
a
little
from
the
text
a
good
chair
makes
a
big
difference
if
you
don
t
like
your
chair
go
find
a
better
one
you
really
want
adjustments
for
height
back
angle
back
height
and
maybe
even
seat
tilt
most
arm
rests
seem
to
get
in
the
way
although
some
more
expensive
chairs
have
height
adjustable
arm
rests
which
you
can
also
rotate
out
of
the
way
you
should
find
a
good
store
and
play
with
all
these
chairs
pick
one
that
s
right
for
you
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
i
highly
recommend
just
chairs
the
name
says
it
all
keyboard
drawers
wrist
pads
and
keyboard
replacements
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
controvery
on
how
to
get
this
right
for
some
people
wrist
pads
seem
to
work
wonders
however
with
good
posture
you
shouldn
t
be
resting
your
wrists
on
anything
you
would
prefer
your
keyboard
to
be
right
there
if
you
drop
your
arms
at
your
side
and
then
lift
your
hands
up
at
the
elbow
you
want
your
keyboard
under
your
hands
when
your
elbows
are
at
about
degrees
of
course
you
want
to
avoid
pronation
wrist
extension
and
ulnar
deviation
at
all
costs
wrist
pads
may
or
may
not
help
at
this
you
should
get
somebody
else
to
come
and
look
at
how
you
work
how
you
sit
how
you
type
and
how
you
relax
it
s
often
easier
for
somebody
else
to
notice
your
hunched
shoulders
or
deviated
hands
some
argue
that
the
normal
flat
keyboard
is
antiquated
and
poorly
designed
a
number
of
replacements
are
available
on
the
market

i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
arguments
about
science
in
sci
med
sci
psychology
etc
are
not
about
cases
where
people
are
rejecting
scientific
argument
evidence
proof
they
are
about
cases
where
no
adequate
scientific
research
has
been
done
in
some
cases
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
but
it
isn
t
in
a
format
to
fit
doctrinaire
conceptions
of
what
science
is
here
it
is
again
this
indicates
confusion
between
proof
and
the
process
of
doing
science
you
are
making
precisely
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make
i
fully
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
big
distinction
between
the
process
of
science
and
the
end
result
as
an
end
result
of
science
one
wants
to
get
results
that
are
objectively
verifiable
but
there
is
nothing
objective
about
the
process
of
science
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
experiment
and
empirical
studies
are
an
important
part
of
science
but
they
are
merely
the
culmination
of
scientific
research
the
most
important
part
of
true
scientific
methodology
is
scientific
thinking
without
this
one
does
not
have
any
hypotheses
worth
testing
no
hypotheses
do
not
just
leap
out
at
you
after
you
look
at
enough
data
nor
do
they
simply
come
to
you
in
a
flash
one
day
while
you
re
shaving
or
looking
out
the
window
at
least
not
unless
you
ve
done
a
lot
of
really
good
thinking
beforehand
the
difference
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocre
scientist
does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of
their
empirical
methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they
are
doing
science
merely
because
they
are
conducting
empirical
studies
and
it
bothers
me
even
more
that
there
are
many
fields
such
as
certain
parts
of
psychology
where
there
seems
to
be
no
thinking
at
all
but
mere
studies
testing
ad
hoc
hypotheses
and
i
m
especially
offended
by
russell
turpin
s
repeated
assertion
that
science
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
avoiding
mistakes
simply
avoiding
mistakes
doesn
t
get
you
anywhere
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

finding
someone
out
there
in

who
has
heard
of
something
similar
to
what
i
am
going
to
describe
here
i
have
a
fourteen
year
old
daugter
who
experienced
a
seizure
on
november
at
am
after
eating
kellog
s
frosted
flakes
she
is
perfectly
healthy
had
never
experienced
anything
like
this
before
and
there
is
no
history
of
seizures
in
either
side
of
the
family
all
the
tests
eeg
mri
ekg
came
out
negative
so
the
decision
was
made
to
do
nothing
and
just
wait
to
see
if
it
happened
again
well
we
were
going
along
fine
and
the
other
morning
april
she
had
a
bowl
of
another
kellog
s
frosted
kind
of
cereal
fruit
loops
i
am
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
even
bought
that
junk
but
every
once
in
a
while
so
i
pour
it
in
her
bowl
and
think
oh
oh
this
is
the
same
kind
of
junk
she
was
eating
when
she
had
that
seizure
ten
minutes
later
she
had
a
full
blown
seizures
this
was
her
first
exposure
to
a

since
the
last
seizure
when
i
mentioned
what
she
ate
the
first
time
as
a
possible
reason
for
the
seizure
the
neurologist
basically
negated
that
as
an
idea
now
after
this
second
episode
so
similar
in
nature
to
the
first
even
he
is
scratching
his
head
once
again
her
eeg
looks
normal
which
i
understand
can
happen
even
when
a
person
has
a
seizure
once
again
we
are
waiting
i
have
been
thinking
that
it
would
be
good
to
get
to
as
large
a
group
as
possible
to
see
if
anyone
has
any
experience
with
this
kind
of
thing
i
know
that
members
of
the
medical
community
are
sometimes
loathe
to
admit
the
importance
that
diet
and
foods
play
in
our
general
health
and
well
being
anyway
as
you
can
guess
i
am
worried
sick
about
this
and
would
appreciate
any
ideas
anyone
out
there
has
sorry
to
be
so
wordy
but
i
wanted
to
really
get
across
what
is
going
on
here

before

after

at

more

don

extra

phrase
in
a
discussion
of
the
boundaries
of
science
except
as
a
proposed
definiens
extra
rational
is
a
better
phrase
in
fact
there
are
quite
a
number
of
well
known
cases
of
extra
rational
considerations
driving
science
in
a
useful
direction
for
example
pasteur
discovered
that
racemic
acid
was
a
mixture
of
enantiomers
the
origin
of
stereochemistry
partly
because
he
liked
a
friend
s
crank
theory
of
chemical
action
the
friend
was
wrong
but
pasteur
s
discovery
stood
a
prior
investigator
mitscherlich
looking
at
the
same
phenomenon
had
missed
a
crucial
detail
presumably
because
he
lacked
pasteur
s
motivation
to
find
something
that
distinguished
racemic
acid
from
tartaric
now
we
say
d
tartaric
acid
again
pasteur
discovered
the
differential
fermentation
of
enantiomers
tartaric
acid
again
not
because
of
some
rational
conviction
but
because
he
was
trying
to
produce
yeast
that
lived
on
l
tartaric
acid
his
notebooks
contained
fantasies
of
becoming
the
newton
of
mirror
image
life
which
he
never
admitted
publically
perhaps
the
best
example
is
the
discovery
that
dna
carries
genes
avery
started
this
work
because
of
one
of
his
students
and
ardent
anglophile
and
francophobe
canadian
defended
fred
griffiths
discoveries
in

most
of
griffiths
critics
were
french
which
decided
the
issue
for
the
student
avery
told
him
to
replicate
griffiths
work
in

which
the
student
eventually
did
whereupon
avery
was
convinced

released
today
by
the

reveals
that
about
large
water
systems
serving
cities
from
boston
to
san
francisco
do
not
filter
to
remove
disease
carrying
organisms
leaving
those

potentially
vulnerable
to
a

similar

the

these
internal

reveal
that
the

water
contamination
isn

just
a

in

it
s
also
a
problem
in
bozeman
and
boston
as
of
june
about
large
surface
water
systems
on
epa
s
list
probably
will
be
breaking
the
law
the
safe

water
act
requires
all
surface
water
systems
to
either
filter
their
water
or
fully
protect
the
rivers
or
lakes
they
use
from
pollution
olson
continued
some
systems
are
moving
towards
eventually
implementing
filtration
systems
but
are
expected
to
miss
the
law
s
deadline
olson
pointed
out
that
the
threat
of
contamination
is
already
a
reality
in
other
cities
a
survey
of
u
s
surface
water
systems
by
water
utility
scientists
found
that
percent
of
raw
water
samples
contained
the
milwaukee

cryptosporidium

a

this
new

raises
a
huge

sign
that
millions
of
americans
can
no
longer
simply
turn
on
their

and
be
assured
that
their

we

immediately
put

to

sources
from

and
where
this

not

filtration
equipment
must

to

olson
noted
the
time
has
come
for
many
of
the

to
stop
dragging

to

exercise

we
were
talking
about

exercise
i
m
the
one
who
can
t
fathom
the
thought

exercise
during
migraine
anyway
turning

thread
around
the
other
day
i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
i
m
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didn
t
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasn
t
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
pm
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isn
t
the
first
time
that
i
ve
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
i
m
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
i
m
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
don
t
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this

one
of

this
certainly
describes
my
situation
perfectly
for
me
there
is
a
constant
dynamic
between
my
tendency
to
eat
which
appears
to
be
totally
limitless
and
the
purely
conscious
desire
to
not
put
on
too
much
weight
when
i
get
too
fat
i
just
diet
exercise
more
with
varying
degrees
of
success
to
take
off
the
extra
weight
usually
i
cycle
within
a
lb
range
but
smaller
and
larger
cycles
occur
as
well
i
m
always
afraid
that
this
method
will
stop
working
someday
but
usually
i
seem
to
be
able
to
hold
the
weight
gain
in
check
this
is
one
reason
i
have
a
hard
time
accepting
the
notion
of
some
metabolic
derangement
associated
with
cycle
dieting
that
results
in
long
term
weight
gain
i
have
been
cycle
dieting
for
at
least
years
without
seeing
such
a
change
i
think
a
vigorous
exercise
program
can
go
a
long
way
toward
keeping
the

smaller

weight
low

comes

in

them
to

the
point
in

is
this
hypotheses
and
speculation
in

may
come
from
wild
flights
of
fancy
daydreams
ancient
traditions
modern

anywhere
else
russell
yes

typically
they
don

not
every

that
when

provide
an
example
of
this
sort
the
only
one
they
come
up
with
is
the
one
about
kekule
surely
there
must
be
others
but
apparently
this
is
regarded
as
an
extreme
example
of
a
non
rational
process
in
science
whereby
a
successful
hypothesis
was
proposed
but
how
non
rational
is
it
of
course
we
can
t
hope
currently
at
least
to
explain
how
or
why
kekule
had
the
daydream
of
snakes
in
the
fire
biting

surely
it
wasn

the
only
daydream
he
had
what
was
special
about
this
one
could
it
have
had
something
to
do
with
a
perceived
analogy
between
the
geometry
of
the
snakes
and
problems
concerning

of
molecules
is
such
analogical
reasoning
extra

is
it
rather
at
the
very
heart
of

difference
between

does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of

methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they
are
doing
science
merely
because
they
are
conducting
empirical
studies
and
i
m
especially
offended
by

s
repeated
assertion
that
science
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
avoiding
mistakes
simply
avoiding
mistakes
doesn

get
you
anywhere
i
think
that
lee
lady
and
i
are
talking
at
cross
purposes
above
lady
seems
concerned
with
the
contrast
between
great
science
that
makes
big
advances
in
our
knowledge
and
mediocre
science
that
makes
smaller
steps
in
most
of
this
thread
i
have
been
concerned
with
the
difference
between
what
is
science
and
what
is
not
lee
lady
is
correct
when
she
asserts
that
the
difference
between
einstein
and
the
average
post
doc
physicist
is
the
quality
of
their
thought
but
what
is
the
difference
between
einstein
and
a
genius
who
would
be
a
great
scientist
but
whose
great
thoughts
are
scientifically
screwy
some
would
give
velikovsky
or
korzybski
as
examples
if
you
don
t
like
these
choose
your
own
i
say
it
is
the
same
as
the
difference
between
the
mediocre
physicist
and
the
mediocre
proponent
of
qi
both
einstein
and
the
mediocre
physcists
have
disciplined
their
work
from
the
cumulative
knowledge
of
how
previous
researchers
went
wrong
both
velikovsky
and
the
mediocre
proponent
of
qi
have
failed
to
do
this
let
me
approach
this
from
a
second
direction
when
one
is
asked
to
review
a
paper
for
a
journal
or
conference
there
are
many
kinds
of
criticism
that
one
can
make
one
kind
of
criticism
is
that
the
work
is
just
wrong
or
misinformed
another
kind
of
criticism
is
that
the
work
while
technically
correct
is
either
not
important
or
not
interesting
the
first
difference
is
the
one
that
i
have
been
pointing
to
the
second
difference
is
the
one
that
lee
lady
seems
to
be
discussing
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
i
have
often
pointed
out
that
for
homeopathy
to
be
considered
scientific
what
is
needed
is
a
test
of
its
theoretical
claims
not
just
of
some
of
its
proposed
remedies
similarly
i
suspect
that
traditional
chinese
medicine
has
many
remedies
that
work
what
it
lacks
as
one
example
is
any
experiment
that
tests
the
presence
of
qi
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
certainly
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
is
the
goal
in
areas
where
we
do
not
yet
have
this
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
forming
and
testing
smaller
hypotheses
let
s
face
it
we
cannot
always
wait
for
an
einstein
to
come
along
and
make
everything
clear
for
us
sometimes
those
of
us
who
are
not
einstein
have
to
plug
along
and
make
small
amounts
of
progress
as
best
we
can

here
is
another
anecdotal
story
i
am
a
picky
eater
and
never
wanted
to
try
chinese
food
however
i
finally
tried
some
in
order
to
please
a
girl
i
was
seeing
at
the
time
i
had
never
heard
of
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
a
group
of
us
went
to
the
restaurant
and
all
shared
different
dishes
it
didn
t
taste
great
but
i
decided
it
wasn
t
so
bad
we
went
home
and
went
to
bed
early
i
woke
up
at
am
and
puked
my
guts
outs
i
threw
up
for
so
long
that
i
m
not

i
pulled

dry

everything
no

got

and
i
m

anything
that
i
know
of
suffice
to
say
that
i
wont
go
into
a
chinese
restaurant
unless
i
am
physically
threatened
the
smell
of
the
food
makes
me
ill
and
that
is
a
psycholgical
reaction
when
i
have
been
dragged
in
to
suffer
through
beef
and
broccoli
without
any
sauces
i
insist
on
no
msg
i
haven
t
gotten
sick
yet
i
had
a
similar
reaction
to
chinese
food
but
came
to
a
completly
different
conclusion
i
ve
eaten
chinese
food
for
ages
and
never
had
problems
i
went
with
some
chinese
malaysian
friends
to
a
swanky
chinses
rest
and
they
ordered
lots
of
stuff
i
had
never
seen
before
the
only
thing
i
can
remember
of
that
meal
was
the
first
course
scallops
served
in
the
shell
with
a
soy
type
sauce
i
thought
well
i
ve
only
had
scallops
once
and
i
was
sick
after
but
that
could
have
been
a
coincidence
that
night
as
i
sat
on
the
bathroom
floor
sweating
and
emptying
my
stomach
the
hard
way
i
decided
i
would
never
touch
another
scallop
i
may
not
be
allergic
but
i
don
t
want
to
take
the
chance

extra

in

there
are
quite
a
number
of
well
known
cases

extra
rational

driving

in

yeah
but
the
problem
with
holding
up
the
extra
rational
examples
as
exemplars
or
as
refutations
of
well
founded
methodology
is
that
you
run
smack
up
against
such
unuseful
directions
as
lysenko
such
extra
rational
cases
are
curiosities
not
guides
to
methodology
as
has
been
noted
before
there
is
the
distinction
between
motivation
and
method
no
experimental
result
should
be
accepted
unless
it
is
described
in
sufficient
detail
to
be
replicated
and
the
replications
do
indeed
reproduce
the
result
no
theoretical
argument
should
be
accepted
unless
it
is
presented
in
sufficient
detail
to
be
followed
and
reasonable
knowlegeable
people
agree
with
the
force
of
the
logic
but
people
try
experiments
and
pursue
arguments
for
all
sorts
of
crazy
reasons
irrational
motivations
are
not
just
curiousities
they
are
a
large
part
of
the
history
of
science
there
are
a
couple
of
negative
points
to
make
here
a
theory
of
qi
could
conceivably
become
accepted
without
direct
verification
of
the
existence
of
qi
for
example
quarks
are
an
accepted
part
of
the
standard
model
of
physics
with
no
direct
verification
what
would
be
needed
would
be
a
theory
based
on
qi
that
predicted
medical
reality
better
than
the
alternatives
the
central
theoretical
claim
could
lie
forever
beyond
experiment
as
long
as
there
was
a
sufficient
body
of
experimental
data
that
the
qi
theory
predicted
better
than
any
other
i
wouldn
t
hold
my
breath
waiting
for
the
triumph
of
qi
though
i
don
t
think
that
there
is
even
a
coherent
theory
based
on
it
much
less
a
theory
that
explains
anything
at
all
better
than
modern
biology
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
qi
theory
that
would
not
predict
some
way
of
rather
directly
verifying
the
existence
of
qi
science
has
not
historically
progressed
in
any
sort
of
rational
experiment
data
theory
sequence
most
experiments
are
carried
out
and
interpreted
in
pre
existing
theoretical
frameworks
the
theoretical
controversies
of
the
day
determine
which
experiments
get
done
overall
there
is
a
huge
messy
affair
of
personal
jealousies
crazy
motivations
petty
hatreds
and
the
like
that
determines
which
experiments
and
which
computations
get
done
what
keeps
it
going
forward
is
the
critical
function
of
science
results
don
t
count
unless
they
can
be
replicated
the
whole
system
is
a
sort
of
mechanism
for
generate
and
test
the
generate
part
can
be
totally
irrational
as
long
as
the
test
part
works
properly
pasteur
could
believe
whatever
he
liked
about
chemical
activity
and
crystals
but
even
mitscherlich
had
to
agree
that
racemic
acid
crystals
were
handed
that
when
you
separate
them
by
handedness
you
get
two
chemicals
that
rotate
polarized
light
in
opposite
directions
and
the
right
rotating
version
was
indistinguishable
from
tartaric
acid
pasteur
s
irrational
motivation
had
led
to
a
replicable
and
important
result
this
is
where
lysenko
creationists
etc
fail
they
have
usually
not
even
produced
coherent
theories
that
predict
much
of
anything
when
their
theories
do
predict
and
are
contradicted
by
experiment
they
do
not
concede
the
point
and
modify
their
theories
rather
they
try
to
suppress
the
results
lysenko
or
try
to
divert
attention
to
other
evidence

avoiding

it

also
widely
acknowledged
that
perfectionism
is
inimicable
to
creativity
and
in
ordinary
life
perfectionism
carried

a
certain
point
is
indicative
of
a
psychological
disorder
in

becomes
so
paralyzed
by
all
the
possible
mistakes
he
might
make
that
he
is
unable

we

truth
about
the

as

and
we

some
trade
off
between
these
two
desiderata

search
for
scope
and
the
search

if
th
century
mathematicians
had
demanded
total
rigor
from
newton

leibniz
then
there
would
probably
be
no
calculus
today
because
neither
of
the
two
could
explain
calculus
in
a
way
that
really
made
sense
since
they
lacked
the
concept
of
a
limit
and
in
fact
because
of
the
lack
of
a
rigorous
foundation
they
made
a
number
of
errors
in
their
use
of
calculus
it
was
only
a
hundred
years
later
that

grounding

nonetheless
what
newton

did
was
undoubtedly
science

if

it
s
not
science
taken
to
the
extreme
i
believe
that
the
attitude
that
empirical
studies
are
everything
and
ideas
are
nothing
results
in
a
complete
stultification
of
science
for
one
thing
an
insistence
on
an
elaborate
and
expensive
methodology
results
in
a
sort
of
scientific
trade
unionism
where
those
outside
the
establishment
and
lacking
institutional
or
corporate
support
have
no
chance
to
obtain
a
hearing
i
don
t
in
the
least
believe
that
this
is
the
intention
of
the
arbiters
of
scientific
methodology
nonetheless
it
is
one
of
the
results
and
although
institutional
science
has
certainly
produced
many
wonderful
results
i
think
it
is
a
foolish
arrogance
for
scientists
to
believe
that
no
one
outside
the
establishment
and
using
less
than
perfect
empirical
methodology
will
ever
come
with
anything
worthwhile
furthermore
the
big
bucks
approach
to
science
promotes
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
most
significant
errors
in
science
choosing
to
investigate
questions
because
they
can
be
readily
handled
by
the
currently
fashionable
methodology
or
because
one
can
readily
get
institutional
or
corporate
sponsorship
for
them
instead
of
directing
attention
to
those
questions
which
seem
to
have
fundamental
significance
for
instance
certain
questions
cannot
be
easily
investigated
with
statistical
methods
because
the
relevant
factors
are
not
quantitative
one
could
argue
that
this
is
the
case
for
almost
all
questions
in
many
areas
of
psychology
in
my
opinion
a
perusal
of
many
of
the
papers
resulting
from
the
attempt
by
psychologists
to
force
these
questions
into
a
statistical
framework
gives
the
lie
to
russell
turpin
s
assertion
that
current
scientific
methods
avoid
all
known
errors
i
think
that
asking
the
wrong
question
is
probably
the
most
fundamental
error
in
science
ignoring
potentially
valuable
ideas
is
one
of
the
others
and
i
think
that
scientific
journals
are
full
of
all
too
many
studies
done
with
impeccable
empirical
methods
but
which
are
worthless
because
the
wrong
question
was
asked
in
the
first
place
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

the
other
day
i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
i
m
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didn
t
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasn
t
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
pm
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isn
t
the
first
time
that
i
ve
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
i
m
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
i
m
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
don
t
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this
hi
janet
sounds
exactly
like
mine
same
circumstance
same
onset
symptoms
same
cafergot
uselessness
same
duration
in
fact
of
all
the
people
i
know
who
have
migraines
none
have
been
so
similar
there
is
such
a
wide
variation
between
people
with
respect
to
what
causes
their
headaches
that
i
generally
don
t
bother
sharing
what
i
ve
learned
about
mine
but
since
ours
seem
to
be
alike
here
are
my
observations
i
don
t
think
it
s
heat
per
se
i
ve
had
more
in
winter
than
summer
dehydration
could
conceivably
figure
though
try
tanking
up
before
playing
rather
than
after
being
in
shape
doesn
t
seem
to
help
me
much
either
i
ve
identified
four
factors
that
do
make
a
difference
listed
in
descending
order
of
importance
heavy
exercise
sleep
deprivation
fasting
e
g
skipped
breakfast
physical
trauma
e
g
head
bonk
heavy
exercise
has
preceded
all
of
my
post
adolescent
migraines
but
i
don
t
get
migraines
after
every
heavy
exercise
session
one
or
more
of
the
other
factors
must
be
present
usually
since
i
discovered
this
i
ve
been
nearly
migraine
free
relapsing
only
once
every
two
or
three
years
when
i
get
cocky
it
s
been
so
long
maybe
i
just
don
t
get
them
anymore
and
stop
being
careful
hope
this
is
helpful

psoriatic
arthritis
info
needed
please
a
friend
of
mine
has
been
diagnosed
with
psoriatic
arthritis
as
a
result
of
trauma
sustained
in
a
car
accident
several
years
ago
the
psoriasis
is
under
control
but
the
arthritis
part
of
the
illness
is
not
ansaid
non
steroidal
anti
inflammatory
worked
pretty
well
for
three
years
but
isn
t
helping
much
now
my
friend
is
now
taking
meclomen
another
nsaid
but
this
isn
t
helping
control
the
pain
at
all
in
the
past
two
months
my
friend
has
also
started
taking
azulfadine
along
with
the
nsaid
medicines
but
the
effects
of
the
combined
drugs
aren
t
supposed
to
be
realized
for
several
months
as
a
result
of
the
pain
my
friend
is
having
problems
sleeping
staying
in
one
position
too
long
is
an
ordeal
another
major
contributor
to
pain
is
that
tendonitis
has
now
developed
left
thumb
and
hand
with
numbness
at
the
base
of
the
palm
bottom
of
feet
shoulders
and
outer
thighs
the
tendonitis
is
quite
painful
yet
my
friend
s
doctor
has
not
recommended
any
form
of
treatment
to
relieve
it
the
latest
twist
is
that
the
doctor
has
dropped
the
anti
inflammatories
and
is
now
recommending
prednisone
the
hope
is
that
the
prednisone
will
relieve
some
of
the
pain
from
the
tendonitis
my
friend
is
a
year
old
male
who
feels
like
he
s
his
words
not
mine
if
anyone
is
aware
of
any
new
treatments
for
psoriatic
arthritis
alternative
courses
of
action
support
groups
or
literature
on
it
i
would
be
extremely
grateful
if
you
could
e
mail
to
me
if
anyone
is
interested
i

the

if

it

she
s

her
eyes
are

she
s
been
going
to
mass
eye

ear
and
the
doctors
there
have
no
clue
what
the
actual
cause
is
they
have
apparently
tried
eyedrops
and
such
she
is
just
about
completely
blind
in
one
eye
and
the
other
is
massively
deteriorated
sjogren
s
syndrome
has
been
known
to
induce
dryness
in
vaginal
tissue
as
well
as
induce
primary
biliary
cirrhosis
otherwise
the
abdominal
swelling
could
be
due
to
a
complication
of
sjogren
s
known
as
pseudolymphoma
which
can
produce
a
splenomegaly
enlarged
spleen
she
should
definitely
see
a
rheumatologist
since
you
don
t
mention
skin

anemia

you
d
probably
rule
out
erythema

the

the
step
they

next
is
to
do
a
whole
battery
of
tests
to
check
all

goes
forward
and
it
is
not
clear
what
this
means
given
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
by
generating
in
a
completely
non
rational
and
even
random
way
a
plethora
of
hypotheses
and
theories
that
are
then
weeded
out
via
the
critical
function
of
science
though
why
this
critical
function
should
be
less
subject
to
the
non
rational
forces
is
a
mystery
if
experimental
design
hypotheses
creation
and
theory
construction
are
subject
to
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
then
this
must
be
equally
true
of
the
application
of
any
critical
function
concerning
replication
this
is
what
leads
one

true
the
generation
part
can
be
totally
irrational
but
typically
it

not
anecdotes
concerning
instances
where
a
hypothesis
seems
to
have
resulted
in

way
from

or

it

is
an

i
